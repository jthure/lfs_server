Live for Speed DCon command line options and text commands
==========================================================


Command line options:
---------------------
DCon.exe can be started using a command line or another program.

Before selecting host options, you may find it helpful to run LFS
and try out the options on the Start New Game screen - the required
upload bandwidth for those options is displayed on screen.

A command line or a command file is required.

You can use a command file xxx.txt instead of a long command line.
A command file contains the command line parameters.
The parameters can be spread onto several lines.
The command file can contain comments, starting with two slashes //
Then the command line would be simply:

DCon /cfg=xxx.txt (where xxx.txt is the name of the command file)

If you do not use a command line at all, DCon tries to open a command
file named "setup.cfg" - an example setup.cfg is provided.

Host commands:
--------------
Some text commands are intended for hosts and administrators.

Using the normal text message system (pressing T in a normal host or
simply typing into a nogfx host), the message becomes a command if you
start it with a slash character.

Simple commands with no parameter:

/qualify             :start qualifying
/end                 :return to race setup screen
/help                :get list of commands
/reinit              :total restart (removes all connections)
/ck                  :cancel any kick or ban votes in progress
/cv                  :cancel game votes (restart / end / qualify)
/zero_all            :reset lap counters on all cars

Commands with a parameter - race setup screen:

/track XXCR [W]      :track and config      (e.g. BL1 / SO3R / FE4)

/laps X              :number of laps        (0 = practice)

The host commands are also available to any user who has connected to
the host using the admin password if one was specified when the host
was started.


To display a welcome message on a host:
---------------------------------------
Create a text file named "X.txt" in your LFS folder.
Type up to 200 characters into the text file.

Use the command /welcome=X.txt in your startup command line


To restrict the tracks allowed on a host:
-----------------------------------------
Create a text file named "X.txt" in your LFS folder.
List all the tracks and configurations you want to allow.
Type one configuration on each line.
You must use the short name of the tracks:
[first two letters of name] [config number] [reversed]

Example:

BL1
BL1R
BL2
BL2R
FE1
FE1R

Use the command /tracks=X.txt in your startup command line


Local commands:
---------------
Most of these text commands replicate functions usually controlled by
pressing on-screen buttons but can be useful in other situations, for
example when controlling LFS from an external program using InSim.

Race setup screen only:

/clear               :clear all racers from list

Any time:

/exit                :exit LFS
/out X               :only seen by external programs
/log X.txt           :set message log file

Commands for scripts:

/run X               :run the script X     (data\script\X.lfs)
/hrun X              :run script X on host (admins only)
/exec E C            :run program E        (with command line C)
/wait E C            :like exec but LFS hangs until E exits

IN A SCRIPT: //comment - this line is ignored
IN CHAT BOX: //xxx - short for /run xxx


Car Strings:
------------
The /cars command for the startup command line or for
hosts or admins uses the three-letter car codes.

Example:

/cars=XFG+XRG        :Allow XF GTI and XR GT
/cars=MRT            :Allow MRT5 only

These Car Groups can be used as well:

ALL    - all cars
ROAD   - road legal cars
RACE   - race cars
TBO    - same as XRT+RB4+FXO
LRF    - same as LX6+RAC+FZ5
GTR    - same as FXR+XRR+FZR

The plus and minus symbols can be used in conjuction with these:

/cars=TBO+LX4        :Allow XRT, RB4, FXO and LX4
/cars=ROAD-UF1       :Allow all road cars except the UF 1000
